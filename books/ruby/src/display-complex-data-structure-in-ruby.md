# Pretty printing complex data structures in Ruby - like Data::Dumper in Perl

Creating complex data structures (hashes of hashes of arrays of hashes of arrays....) is easy in Ruby.

Unedrstanding what we have on our hand can be a bit more difficult.

Perl has a build in modules called [Data::Dumper](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper)
that can be used to pirnt complex data structures, for example when
[debugging Perl programs](https://perlmaven.com/debugging-perl-scripts).

Ruby has [pp, the Pretty Printer](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/pp/rdoc/PP.html) for the same purpose.
